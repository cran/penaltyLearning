TODOs

tests/support for flsa and HMM?

- option to not stop in labelError if there is the same number of
  changes in two models.

IntervalRegressionCV uses future instead of foreach.

corrections encountered while preparing tutorial,

- theme_no_space() evaluated at runtime rather than theme_no_space
  which was evaluated at build time.

- stop with an error if there are models that have the same number of
  changes -- this prevents problems for changepoint models, but
  prevents using the code with L1 regularized models (fused lasso).

- stop with an error in targetIntervals if the errors column is not
  numeric. And return an errors column (the minimum number of
  incorrect labels).

prepare for CRAN submission:
- convert to src/*.cpp files and register routines.
- NULL variables to avoid CRAN checks about global variables.
- vignette.
- many more user-friendly error messages.
- coefficients of IntervalRegression models are
  now returned on the original scale.

IntervalRegression S3 class with plot, print, and predict methods.

largestContinuousMinimum C implementation.

more informative error messages when arguments to R functions are not
as expected.

check for bigger/smaller data sets in ROChange and labelError.

check for errors in C code and return with non-zero status.

labelError works when there are more models than labels, and gives an
informative error when there are no corresponding models for a given
label.
